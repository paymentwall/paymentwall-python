# Code Samples

## Digital Goods API

#### Initializing Paymentwall
<pre><code>from paymentwall import *
Paymentwall.set_api_type(Paymentwall.API_GOODS)
Paymentwall.set_app_key('APPLICATION_KEY') # available in your merchant area
Paymentwall.set_secret_key('SECRET_KEY') # available in your merchant area
</code></pre>

#### Widget Call
[Web API details](http://www.paymentwall.com/en/documentation/Digital-Goods-API/710#paymentwall_widget_call_flexible_widget_call)

The widget is a payment page hosted by Paymentwall that embeds the entire payment flow: selecting the payment method, completing the billing details, and providing customer support via the Help section. You can redirect the users to this page or embed it via iframe. Below is an example that renders an iframe with Paymentwall Widget.

<pre><code>product = Product(
    'product301',              # id of the product in your system 
    12.12,                     # price
    'USD',                     # currency code
    'test',                    # product name
    Product.TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION, # this is a time-based product
    1,                         # duration is 1
    Product.PERIOD_TYPE_WEEK,  #               week
    True                       # recurring
)

widget = Widget(
    'user4522',   # id of the end-user who's making the payment
    'p1_1',       # widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
    [product],    # product details for Flexible Widget Call. To let users select the product on Paymentwall's end, leave this array empty
    {'email': 'user@hostname.com'}    # additional parameters
)
print(widget.get_html_code())
</code></pre>

#### Pingback Processing

The Pingback is a webhook notifying about a payment being made. Pingbacks are sent via HTTP/HTTPS to your servers. To process pingbacks use the following code:
<pre><code>pingback = Pingback({x:y for x, y in request.args.iteritems()}, request.remote_addr)

if pingback.validate():
    product_id = pingback.get_product().get_id()
    if pingback.is_deliverable():
        # deliver the product
        pass
    elif pingback.is_cancelable():
        # withdraw the product
        pass

    print('OK') # Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent

else:
    print(pingback.get_error_summary())</code></pre>

## Virtual Currency API

#### Initializing Paymentwall
<pre><code>from paymentwall import *
Paymentwall.set_api_type(Paymentwall.API_VC)
Paymentwall.set_app_key('APPLICATION_KEY')

</code></pre>

#### Widget Call
<pre><code>widget = Widget(
	'user40012', # id of the end-user who's making the payment
	'p1_1',      # widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	[],          # array of products - leave blank for Virtual Currency API
	{'email': 'user@hostname.com'} # additional parameters
)
print(widget.get_html_code())
</code></pre>

#### Pingback Processing
<pre><code>pingback = Pingback({x:y for x, y in request.args.iteritems()}, request.remote_addr)
if pingback.validate():
    virtual_currency = pingback.get_vc_amount()
    if pingback.is_deliverable():
        # deliver the virtual currency
        pass
    elif pingback.is_cancelable():
        # withdraw the virtual currency
        pass 
  print('OK') # Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent
else:
  print(pingback.get_error_summary())
end</code></pre>

#### Initializing Paymentwall
<pre><code>from paymentwall import *
Paymentwall.set_api_type(Paymentwall.API_CART)
Paymentwall.set_app_key('APPLICATION_KEY')

</code></pre>

<pre><code>widget = Widget(
	'user40012', # id of the end-user who's making the payment
	'p1_1',      # widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	[
		Product('product301', 3.33, 'EUR'), # first product in cart
		Product('product607', 7.77, 'EUR')  # second product in cart
	],
	{'email': 'user@hostname.com'} # additional params
)
print(widget.get_html_code())</code></pre>

#### Pingback Processing
<pre><code>pingback = Pingback({x:y for x, y in request.args.iteritems()}, request.remote_addr)
if pingback.validate():
    products = pingback.get_products()
    if pingback.is_deliverable():
        # deliver the virtual currency
        pass
    elif pingback.is_cancelable():
        # withdraw the virtual currency
        pass 
  print('OK') # Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent
